                Tic-Tac-Toe with a Twist: Minefield Rules<br><br>

1. Mine Placement : A single mine is randomly placed in one of the 9 boxes, but it remains invisible to the players.<br><br>

2. Mine Avoidance : Each player must avoid stepping on the mine for first 3 moves. If a player successfully avoids the mine, their turn continues.<br><br>

3. Game Over : If a player lands on the mine, they instantly lose the game, regardless of their chances of winning.<br><br>

4. Luck of the Draw : This game is heavily influenced by luck, as the mine's location is random and hidden.<br><br>

5. Unpredictable Outcomes : It's possible to win a game that seemed lost or lose a game that was almost won, all due to the mine's presence.<br><br>

6. Winning Conditions : To emerge victorious, a player must win the game by normal Tic-Tac-Toe rules while successfully avoiding the mine for first 3 moves.<br><br>
